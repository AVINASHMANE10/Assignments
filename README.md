## Smart Home System Project

The **Smart Home System** is a Java-based application demonstrating the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles such as **interfaces**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**. This project simulates a smart home environment where users can manage and interact with various smart devices.

### Key Features

- Manage multiple smart devices like **Smart Thermostat**, **Smart Speaker**, and **Smart TV**.
- Menu-driven interface for intuitive navigation and interaction.
- Persistent device states and validation for operations.

### How to Run

1. Navigate to the `SmartHomeSystem` folder.
2. Compile the source files and run the application.
3. Execute unit tests using JUnit.

## Multi-Threaded File Downloader

This project implements a **multi-threaded file downloader** using JavaScript and provides a web-based interface for downloading files efficiently.

### Key Features

- Multi-threaded downloads using **Web Workers**.
- Real-time progress tracking and controls for pause, resume, and cancel.
- Offline handling with automatic pause/resume on connectivity changes.

### How to Use

1. Navigate to the `MultiThreadedDownloader` folder.
2. Run the project on a local web server.
3. Open the application in your browser to initiate downloads and monitor progress.
